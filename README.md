### ALL FILES IN HEADERS AND SRC SHOULD BE IN THE SAME FOLDER FOR WORKING / YOU MAY GIVE THEIR PATHS IF NOT
### 1. Clone the repository
### 2. Place all the files in one folder
### 3. You may either run by command by giving paths of all .cpp files or by writing .cpp files in main.cpp and then simply run

📌 Important Notes

First run requires admin setup → restart after creating admin
Passwords are stored in plain text (for educational purposes only)
Fine = 50 units per overdue day
Due period = 30 days from issue date
No input sanitization for special characters yet (keep usernames simple)
